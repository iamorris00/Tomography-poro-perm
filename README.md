# Predicting porosity and permeability from CT images and data.
This repository is divided into jupyter files, each file develops a specific task, which are divided into subfolders.

Work-floe of the study:
1. First using noise in some software like excel to multiply the avilable data. [demo of the data](https://github.com/iamorris00/Tomography-poro-perm/tree/main/available%20data)
2. Sectioning of the images with the file: [image cropping](https://github.com/iamorris00/Tomography-poro-perm/tree/main/Image_Cropping)
3. Design, training and metrics analysis of the data: [Training models](https://github.com/iamorris00/Tomography-poro-perm/tree/main/Design%20and%20training%20of%20the%20models)
4. Predict properties by loading the models already trained in .h5 format: [Pred propertiers](https://github.com/iamorris00/Tomography-poro-perm/tree/main/Predict%20properties)
